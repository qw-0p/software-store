## About project
Hi everyone, glad to see you in my repository, my name is Oleksandr Sarkisov I am Full Stack Developer and now I will tell you what this project is for and how to use it. 
Software Store is an analogue of any e-commerce shop where you can register, choose products, add them to your basket and make purchases. 
It was created as a pet project, so you won't be able to buy anything ðŸ˜„.
<i>At the moment this project is in development status. I can't guarantee its stability.</i>


## How to run
- Clone repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/qw-0p/software-store.git
```
- Move to the clone folder and run the project using the Makefile
```
cd software-store
make up
```
If you don't have Docker installed, it's best to install it, but you can always run without it. <br>

```
pnpm install
```
Move to folder server or client and run project
